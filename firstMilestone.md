1) What is the current goal of your project?

The current goal of my project is to make an app that will take you to Crossroads and show you how to get there.

2) What have you accomplished so far toward that goal?

I have been able to get the line and user location to appear so that you can follow the line to Crossroads.

3) What do we need to know if we want to run your project in its current state? For example, maybe this app can only be run on your phone, not in Simulator. Or maybe there are a couple of bugs that the user needs to avoid for now.

Right now if you run my app you will see a line that will take you to Crossroads but the app is still very raw looking and doesn't look like a direction app.

4) What percentage of your goal would you estimate you have completed? Measure this in time spent working on the project so far and the amount of time you estimate you would need in order to complete the project. So if, for example, you've worked 10 hours on this project and you think it would take 15 more hours to complete it, then you are 40% of the way done.

I would say I am 60% of the way through as I have the line and it will take you to crossroads except the app still needs more features to look nice as well as other handy features.

5) What is the most significant achievement you've made so far on this project? This could be something you built (a feature of the app) or the way that you built it (the way your code is written).

MY most significant achievement is getting the line to appear from the users location to the coordinates of the point(which is crossroads).

6) What do you anticipate being the hardest part of the remainder of your project?\

The hardest part is probably going to be a time estimate I want to the app to be able to tell you how much time it will take you to get to crossroads from where ever you are from.
