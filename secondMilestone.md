# Second Milestone

## What was the original goal of your project?
My original goal of this project was to be able to get directions to Xrds. My main goal was to get a direction line to appear to lead the user to the set location.

## How have the goals of your project changed?

My project goals have changed a little since I am now trying to implement an ETA function. This has proven a little more challenging then the direction line. Hopefully with a little more research I will be able to get around this problem.

## What is a significant thing that you learned while building this project?

To complete this project I needed to learn more about MapKit. I found out how many functions MapKit is useful for. There are tons of thing you can do with it. I was able to do research and learn about how to implement the direction line function.


## Describe an unexpected challenge that came up during this project, and how you overcame it.

An unexpected challenge is the ETA I thought it was going to be relativley easy with the research I did but I am confused on what to do. So I need to do more looking on the internet to find an answer.

## Knowing what you know now, if you were to rebuild this project completely from scratch, what would you do differently, and why?

I wouldn't do anything differently at least right now since everything has gone pretty smoothly. I haven't run into many errors when doing the useres location or adding the direction line. My only problem has been the ETA function but that is because there is less information on the internet about it. Everything has gone pretty nicely so I wouldn't change anything.
